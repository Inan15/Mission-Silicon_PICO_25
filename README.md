# Mission-Silicon_PICO_25

We aim to extend the existing OSU standard cell library by designing and validating additional logic cells. This will enhance the cell coverage for more efficient logic synthesis.
We propose to design and characterize three new logic cells: XNOR3_1, OR3_1, and NOR3_1, for the 12T track.We aim to extend our contribution as time permits
These additional cells can support improved synthesis and optimization in digital design flows using open-source tools.
